description: How I made a funny website to track how many times I say 'Womp Womp'
---

As of right now, I have over 300 'womps' tracked on ['Womp Womp'](https://counter.womp.lol).


### Why 'Womp Womp'?

I'm a big fan of the 'Womp Womp' meme. I started saying ironically in early 2024, but it has spiraled out of control. It's become an issue that I can't ignore.

So I decided to make a website to allow my friends to track how many times I say 'Womp Womp'. Maybe it will help me get over it...
